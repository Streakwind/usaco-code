1. can there be a duplicate?
2. what if everything is the same?
3. what if the difference between the numbers is very small? (applies to some questions)
4. are you covering the edge case for all of the code or just a specific part?
5. are you resetting all your variables after each iteration? (if needed)
6. for double for loops: using m++ or i++?
7. run through your code... does everything work?
